# 🗂️ Sentiment Analysis of Beat Speaker Reviews

## 🔍 Overview  
This project analyzes customer sentiment toward wireless speakers by scraping and processing Amazon reviews. Using Python libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **TextBlob**, the goal was to extract insights into what customers love (or don’t love) about the product — helping brands like Beats by Dre better understand their audience.

## 💻 How to Run
1. Clone the repo or open the notebook in Google Colab  
2. Install dependencies (if running locally):  

```
pip install pandas numpy textblob matplotlib seaborn
``` 

3. Run each Python script or notebook file in sequence to follow the data pipeline:
   - `copy_of_json_reviews_to_dataframe.py` (load reviews)
   - `pandas.py`, `p3_s4_3.py`, etc. (EDA + sentiment code)
   - `p3_s4_12.py` (TextBlob sentiment + final analysis)
